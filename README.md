# 🧠 Algorithm

This repository contains solutions to algorithm problems from various online judges. The goal is to keep all solutions well-organized by platform and language, and to include reusable base implementations for common algorithms and data structures.

---

## 🔧 Base Functions

Reusable implementations of common algorithms are stored in the `base/` directory. These can be imported or copied into solution files when needed.

Examples:
- `dijkstra.py`: Dijkstra’s shortest path algorithm
- `miller_rabin.py`: Miller-Rabin primality test
- `segment_tree.py`: Segment Tree with lazy propagation

Separate folders are used for different programming languages (e.g., `python`, `cpp`).

---

## 🌐 Supported Platforms

- [Baekjoon Online Judge](https://www.acmicpc.net/)
- [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/)
- Others (e.g., AtCoder, LeetCode) may be added later under `others/`.

---

## 💬 Supported Languages

- Python 🐍
- C++ 💻  
More languages (like Java or Kotlin) can be added as needed, each under their own subfolder.

---

## 📌 File Naming Convention

Each solution file is named using the problem number or code and the name of the problem:

- `1000 (A + B).py`: Problem #1000 on Baekjoon
- `1234A.cpp`: Problem 1234A on Codeforces

---

## 📦 Usage

- Navigate to the judge’s folder (e.g., `baekjoon/` or `codeforces/`)
- Select the desired language subfolder (e.g., `python/`)
- Open the file corresponding to the problem number or code to view the solution

You can also reuse any base function by importing or copying from the `base/` directory.
